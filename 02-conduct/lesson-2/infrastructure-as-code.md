# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a modern approach to managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

## Key Benefits of IaC
- **Consistency:** Ensures that the same environment is replicated across development, testing, and production.
- **Version Control:** Infrastructure configurations can be versioned and tracked just like application code.
- **Automation:** Reduces manual intervention, enabling faster and more reliable deployments.
- **Scalability:** Makes it easier to scale infrastructure up or down based on demand.

## Popular IaC Tools
- **Terraform:** A tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
- **Ansible:** An automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
- **CloudFormation:** AWS's native IaC tool for managing AWS resources.

## Best Practices
1. Use version control systems like Git to manage IaC files.
2. Modularize configurations for better reusability and maintainability.
3. Test configurations in a staging environment before applying them to production.
4. Use descriptive naming conventions for resources and variables.

IaC is a cornerstone of modern DevOps practices, enabling teams to deliver infrastructure changes with the same agility as application code.
