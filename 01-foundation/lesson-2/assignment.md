# Assignment: AI Project ROI Decision Tree

As the Chief Architect at a coffee company, your CEO has requested that you create a presentation within 30 minutes. The presentation should:

1. Clearly outline a decision tree for evaluating the ROI of AI projects during an intake review.
2. Focus specifically on the coffee importing, roasting, distribution, and delivery processes.
3. Be tailored for non-technical stakeholders, ensuring clarity and simplicity.

Remember, the goal is to make the decision-making process accessible and actionable for the intended audience.
