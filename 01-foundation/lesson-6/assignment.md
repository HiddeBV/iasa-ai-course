# Lesson 6 Assignment: Enterprise RAG System for Historical Document Analysis

## Assignment Overview

**Scenario:** Your CEO walks into your office and asks that within 30 minutes you create a presentation that clearly shows her:

How to incorporate managed services offered by your company's primary cloud vendor into a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application to understand historical trends based off of every invoice and bill of lading produced by your company during its 20+ year history.

## Requirements

Your proposal should include:

1. **Which services will be used**
   - Identify specific managed cloud services for each component of the RAG pipeline
   - Justify your service selections based on scalability, cost, and functionality

2. **Estimated cost breakdown**
   - Provide realistic cost estimates for storage, compute, and AI services
   - Consider data volume (20+ years of invoices and bills of lading)
   - Include both initial setup and ongoing operational costs

3. **Application monitoring strategy**
   - Define key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics
   - Specify monitoring tools and alerting mechanisms
   - Include data quality and AI model performance monitoring

## Target Audience

- **Chief Data Officer (CDO)**
- **Data Scientists**

*Note: Tailor your technical depth and business value propositions accordingly*

## Deliverable

Create a presentation (slides or detailed outline) that can be delivered in 10-15 minutes, covering all requirements above.

## Key Considerations

- **Data Privacy & Compliance:** Address how sensitive financial data will be handled
- **Scalability:** System should handle 20+ years of documents and growing data
- **Performance:** Response times for trend analysis queries
- **Integration:** How this fits into existing enterprise data architecture
- **ROI:** Business value and expected return on investment

## Technical Components to Address

### Data Pipeline
- Document ingestion and preprocessing
- OCR and text extraction for scanned documents
- Data validation and quality checks
- Vector embedding generation

### Storage & Retrieval
- Document storage solutions
- Vector database for embeddings
- Metadata management
- Search and retrieval mechanisms

### AI/ML Services
- Large Language Models for generation
- Embedding models for document vectorization
- Fine-tuning capabilities for domain-specific performance

### Infrastructure
- Compute resources for processing
- API management and rate limiting
- Security and access controls
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Bonus Points

- Include a high-level architecture diagram
- Propose a phased implementation approach
- Address potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Consider multi-cloud or hybrid scenarios
- Discuss data governance and lineage tracking

## Success Criteria

Your presentation should demonstrate:
- Clear understanding of RAG architecture
- Practical knowledge of cloud managed services
- Business acumen for cost-benefit analysis
- Technical depth appropriate for the audience
- Actionable implementation roadmap
