# Lab

Your CEO walks into your office, and asks that within 30 minutes you create a presentation that clearly shows her:

• What processes are necessary within the AI CoE to keep the technical, legal, and compliance teams up to date with the innovations in the AI space for Tinkleman Coffee

• Recommendations for how the various teams within your organization should be thinking of AI use cases, how to justify the ROI of these implementations within the context of your organization's business goals and unique lines of business

• The audience for this presentation will be the data science and AppDev teams
