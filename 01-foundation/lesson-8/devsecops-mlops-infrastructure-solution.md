# DevSecOps vs MLOps Infrastructure Presentation - Solution

## Executive Summary for CIO

**Presentation Title:** "Infrastructure Strategy: DevSecOps vs MLOps for Coffee Operations"  
**Duration:** 15 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A  
**Audience:** CIO

---

## Slide 1: Executive Overview
- **DevSecOps**: Secure software delivery pipeline for customer-facing applications
- **MLOps**: Machine learning model lifecycle management for data-driven insights
- **Key Difference**: DevSecOps focuses on code security, MLOps focuses on data quality and model performance

---

## Slide 2: Pipeline Comparison - Coffee Company Context

### DevSecOps Pipeline
- **Purpose**: Secure web apps, mobile ordering, customer portals
- **Security Gates**: Code scanning, dependency checks, penetration testing
- **Deployment**: Blue-green deployments, rollback capabilities
- **Agent Options**:
  - **Microsoft Hosted Agents**: $40/month per parallel job (Azure DevOps)
  - **Self-Hosted Agents**: $15/month per agent + infrastructure costs
  - **GitHub Actions**: $0.008/minute (hosted) vs self-hosted runners (free compute time)
- **Coffee Use Case**: Customer loyalty app, e-commerce platform

### MLOps Pipeline
- **Purpose**: Deploy ML models for demand forecasting, quality control
- **Data Gates**: Data validation, drift detection, model accuracy monitoring
- **Deployment**: A/B testing models, gradual rollouts, performance tracking
- **Coffee Use Case**: Bean quality prediction, inventory optimization

## Slide 3: Critical Infrastructure Requirements

### Hardware Provisioning
- **DevSecOps**: 
  - **Microsoft Hosted**: No infrastructure cost, pay-per-use model
  - **Self-Hosted**: Standard compute (2-4 vCPUs), dedicated build servers
  - **GitHub Actions**: 2,000 free minutes/month, then $0.008/minute for hosted runners
- **MLOps**: GPU clusters (8-16 GPUs), high-memory instances (64-128GB RAM)
- **Storage**: DevSecOps needs 100GB-1TB, MLOps needs 10TB+ for datasets

### Existing Infrastructure Needs
- **Shared**: Kubernetes, monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), CI/CD tools
- **DevSecOps Specific**: 
  - **Hosted Agents**: SAST/DAST tools, secrets management, WAF
  - **Self-Hosted**: Above + dedicated build infrastructure, agent maintenance
- **MLOps Specific**: Data lakes, feature stores, model registries, Jupyter environments

## Slide 4: Investment & Resource Allocation

### Cost Comparison (Annual)
- **DevSecOps Infrastructure**: 
  - **Microsoft Hosted Agents**: $480-960/year (1-2 parallel jobs)
  - **Self-Hosted Agents**: $25K-40K/year (infrastructure + maintenance)
  - **GitHub Actions**: $500-2000/year (depending on usage beyond free tier)
- **MLOps Infrastructure**: $200K-500K (due to GPU requirements)
- **Team Requirements**: 
  - DevSecOps: 3-5 engineers
  - MLOps: 2-4 data scientists + 2-3 ML engineers

### ROI Timeline
- **DevSecOps**: 6-12 months (reduced security incidents, faster releases)
- **MLOps**: 12-18 months (improved forecasting, quality control savings)

## Slide 5: Recommendations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)
1. **Audit current infrastructure** capacity for both pipelines
2. **Assess team skills** gap for ML operations
3. **Pilot MLOps** with coffee quality prediction model

### Strategic Roadmap (6 Months)
- **Phase 1**: Establish DevSecOps for customer applications
- **Phase 2**: Build MLOps platform for demand forecasting
- **Phase 3**: Scale ML capabilities to supply chain optimization

### Budget Request
- **Q3 2025**: $150K for initial MLOps infrastructure
- **Q4 2025**: 
  - **Option A (Hosted)**: $2K for DevSecOps hosted agents + security tooling
  - **Option B (Self-Hosted)**: $30K for DevSecOps self-hosted infrastructure + security tooling
  - **Recommendation**: Start with hosted agents, scale to self-hosted if build volume exceeds 10,000 minutes/month

## Speaking Notes

### Opening (2 minutes)
"Today I'll outline how we can leverage both DevSecOps and MLOps to secure our digital operations while unlocking data-driven insights for our coffee business."

### Key Message for CIO
- DevSecOps protects our customer-facing revenue streams
- MLOps optimizes our operational efficiency and product quality
- Different infrastructure needs require separate budget considerations
- Both are essential for competitive advantage in digital coffee retail

### Anticipated Questions & Answers
**Q: Can we use the same infrastructure for both?**  
A: Partially - shared Kubernetes and monitoring, but MLOps needs specialized GPU compute and larger storage.

**Q: Should we use hosted or self-hosted agents for DevSecOps?**  
A: Start with Microsoft hosted agents ($40/month) or GitHub Actions (free tier) for cost efficiency. Move to self-hosted only if you need specialized security requirements or have high-volume builds.

**Q: Which should we prioritize?**  
A: DevSecOps first for immediate security compliance, then MLOps for competitive differentiation.

**Q: What's the biggest risk?**  
A: For DevSecOps: security breaches. For MLOps: poor data quality leading to bad business decisions.
