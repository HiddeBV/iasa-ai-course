## 4. Artificial Intelligence CoE Models: Finding the Right Fit

| Model | Description | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Centralized** | A single, central team is responsible for all AI development and deployment. | Strong governance, clear ownership, economies of scale. | Can be a bottleneck, may lack business unit context, less agile. |
| **Decentralized** | Each business unit has its own dedicated AI team. | High agility, deep business unit expertise, faster time to market. | Duplicated effort, inconsistent standards, lack of a unified strategy. |
| **Hybrid (Recommended)** | A central CoE provides governance, strategy, and shared services, while business units have their own AI teams to execute projects. | **Balances governance and agility, fosters collaboration, promotes knowledge sharing.** | Requires strong communication and coordination between the CoE and business units. |
