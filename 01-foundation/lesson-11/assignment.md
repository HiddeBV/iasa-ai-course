Here's the lab for Lecture 11

Your CEO walks into your office, and asks that within 30 minutes you create a presentation that clearly shows her:
A proposal for the formation of an AI CoE within your multi-national coffee company, Tinkleman Coffee
The proposal should be comprehensive and actionable, allowing her to understand the centralized versus decentralized model, which key stakeholders are needed and what time commitments are required
The audience for this presentation will be the company’s board of directors


Extra teacher credit: provide real life use cases of companies that have gone down the AI CoE route, what they’ve learned, how they iterated upon the model This is what we need to do for the assignment
