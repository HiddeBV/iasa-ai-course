# The lab for Lecture 1:

You're the Chief Architect at an international coffee importer, Tinkleman, and importer who also franchises coffee shops across the country. Your CEO has walked into your office, and wants you to put together a presentation showing:
* What kind of ML is required to differentiate between pictures of green unroasted, first crack, and second crack coffee beans
* What tooling you could use to implement this flavor of ML
* How would you provide the model training and validation data

Extra teacher credit: if implemented in Tensor Flow, how would you save the model weights and make it available inside of a Docker container using Flask? Create a branch for it, than a pr and then merge it. Deleted the branch when you are done.
