## Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not build monitoring in-house?**  
A: Time-to-value and expertise. Commercial tools provide immediate value and specialized AI monitoring capabilities that would take 12-18 months to develop internally.

**Q: How do we handle multi-cloud monitoring?**  
A: Datadog provides unified monitoring across AWS, Azure, and GCP with single-pane-of-glass visibility.

**Q: What if a vendor goes out of business?**  
A: We recommend Datadog as primary (publicly traded, stable) with WhyLabs as specialized addition. Both provide data export capabilities.

**Q: How do we measure monitoring effectiveness?**  
A: Key metrics: MTTR reduction, incident prevention rate, false positive percentage, and business impact correlation.
