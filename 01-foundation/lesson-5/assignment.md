## Lab Assignment: In-Store Customer Tracking ML Presentation

### Scenario

Your CEO walks into your office and asks that within 30 minutes you create a presentation that clearly shows her your company's plan for implementing an in-store tracking ML system.

### Assignment Overview

Create a comprehensive presentation for the CIO and device teams that outlines your company's strategy for developing a machine learning system that monitors:
- How long a customer has been in the store
- How many drinks a barista has made  
- How long it takes a customer to get their order after paying

### Objectives

- Demonstrate understanding of ML system requirements for real-time customer tracking
- Identify hardware and infrastructure needs for ML deployment
- Present actionable implementation plan to technical stakeholders
- Address regulatory and privacy considerations

### Tasks

### Task 1: Technical Requirements Analysis

Develop a detailed analysis covering:
- ML model specifications for customer tracking
- Data collection methods and sensors needed
- Real-time processing requirements
- Integration with existing POS systems

### Task 2: Hardware Requirements Action Plan

Create an action plan detailing:
- Required hardware components (cameras, sensors, edge devices)
- Computing infrastructure needs (cloud vs edge processing)
- Network requirements for data transmission
- Cost estimates and procurement timeline

### Task 3: Implementation Strategy Presentation

Prepare a presentation for the CIO and device teams including:
- System architecture overview
- Deployment phases and timeline
- Technical specifications and requirements
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Task 4: Regulatory and Privacy Analysis (Extra Credit)

Address the regulatory implications and privacy concerns:
- GDPR compliance requirements
- Customer consent mechanisms
- Data retention and anonymization policies
- Ethical considerations for customer tracking

## Deliverables
