# Lesson 7 Assignment: Coffee Recipe Classification Model Feasibility Analysis

## Scenario
Your CEO has walked into your office with an urgent request. The CIO's office has submitted a proposal recommending the deployment of a classification model across all retail stores. This model would monitor how well each coffee drink produced adheres to the corporate recipe standards.

**Time Constraint:** 30 minutes to prepare and deliver your presentation.

## Assignment Requirements

### Objective
Create a presentation that clearly demonstrates the feasibility challenges and implications of implementing the proposed coffee recipe classification model across retail locations.

### Target Audience
- **Primary:** Company CEO
- **Background:** Technical expertise
- **Expectation:** Clear, data-driven analysis with practical implications

### Key Focus Areas

Your presentation must address the following feasibility challenges:

#### 1. Physical Limitations
- **Opaque vs. Translucent Containers**
  - Visual classification challenges with non-transparent cups
  - Impact on model accuracy and reliability
  - Cost implications of requiring specific cup types

#### 2. Customization Variables
- **Order Modifications**
  - Customer-requested variations (extra shots, different milk types, etc.)
  - How customizations affect recipe adherence metrics
  - Distinguishing between intentional customization vs. preparation errors

#### 3. Technical Implementation Challenges
- **Hardware Requirements**
  - Camera placement and lighting conditions
  - Integration with existing POS systems
  - Maintenance and calibration needs

#### 4. Operational Impact
- **Staff Training and Workflow**
  - Impact on service speed and customer experience
  - Additional training requirements for baristas
  - Handling of false positives/negatives

#### 5. Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **Implementation Costs**
  - Hardware, software, and deployment expenses
  - Ongoing maintenance and support costs
  - ROI timeline and break-even analysis

### Deliverables

1. **Executive Summary Slide**
   - High-level recommendation (feasible/not feasible/conditional)
   - Top 3 critical challenges
   - Proposed alternative approaches (if applicable)

2. **Technical Feasibility Analysis**
   - Detailed breakdown of implementation challenges
   - Evidence-based assessment of each limitation
   - Risk assessment matrix

3. **Business Impact Assessment**
   - Operational implications
   - Customer experience considerations
   - Financial projections

4. **Recommendations**
   - Clear next steps
   - Alternative solutions or pilot program suggestions
   - Timeline for further evaluation (if needed)

### Presentation Guidelines

- **Duration:** 15-20 minutes presentation + 10 minutes Q&A
- **Format:** Professional slide deck (8-12 slides maximum)
- **Tone:** Objective, data-driven, solution-oriented
- **Technical Level:** Appropriate for technically-savvy executive audience

### Success Criteria

Your presentation will be evaluated on:
- Clarity of feasibility assessment
- Depth of technical and business analysis
- Quality of recommendations
- Ability to communicate complex technical concepts to executive audience
- Consideration of alternative solutions

### Submission Requirements

1. Slide deck (PowerPoint or equivalent)
