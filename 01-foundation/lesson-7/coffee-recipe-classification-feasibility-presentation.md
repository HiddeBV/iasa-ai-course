# Coffee Recipe Classification Model: Feasibility Analysis
**Presentation for CEO | 30-Minute Analysis**

---

## Slide 1: Executive Summary
**Recommendation: Not Feasible in Current Form**

### Key Issues:
- **Visual Classification Limitations** - Majority of hot drinks use opaque cups*
- **Customization Variables** - Significant portion of orders include modifications*
- **Implementation Cost** - Estimated $2-3M initial investment*

### Alternative Recommendation:
Pilot program with limited scope focusing on standardized drinks in transparent containers

*Based on operational estimates - exact data would require 2-week analysis

---

## Slide 2: The Proposal
**CIO Office Recommendation:**
- Deploy classification models across all retail stores
- Monitor coffee drink recipe adherence in real-time
- Ensure corporate quality standards

**Critical Question:** Can computer vision reliably assess recipe compliance across our diverse product mix and service conditions?

---

## Slide 3: Primary Technical Barriers

### 1. Container Opacity Challenge
- **Problem:** Most hot drinks served in opaque cups (estimate: 50-70%)*
- **Impact:** Model cannot assess internal composition
- **Solutions:** 
  - Switch to transparent cups (estimated +$0.10-0.20/cup cost)*
  - Limit monitoring to cold drinks only

### 2. Customization Complexity
- **Problem:** High percentage of orders include modifications (estimate: 30-50%)*
- **Challenge:** Distinguishing error vs. customer request
- **Risk:** False positives affecting staff morale

*Estimates based on industry standards - would need POS data analysis for precision

---

## Slide 4: Implementation Challenges

### Hardware Requirements (Per Store)*
- **Cameras:** 2-4 units per store ($500-1,500 estimated)
- **Processing Unit:** Edge computing device ($800-1,500 estimated)
- **Integration:** POS system modifications ($1,500-3,000 estimated)
- **Total per store:** ~$3,000-6,000 (rough estimate)

### Operational Impact
- **Training:** Estimated 4-8 hours per barista
- **Service Speed:** Potential impact (needs measurement)
- **Maintenance:** Regular calibration required

*Hardware costs based on similar retail tech implementations - would need vendor quotes

---

## Slide 5: Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Implementation Costs (Assuming 250 stores)*
- **Hardware:** $750K - $1.5M (rough estimate)
- **Software Development:** $500K - $1M (estimated)
- **Training & Deployment:** $300K - $600K (estimated)
- **Total Initial Investment:** $1.5M - $3.1M (preliminary estimate)

### Projected Benefits**
- **Quality Consistency:** Potential improvement (TBD)
- **Waste Reduction:** Estimated savings (needs baseline)
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Potential impact (requires study)

**ROI Timeline:** Unknown without detailed analysis

*Cost estimates based on similar retail technology deployments
**Benefits require detailed operational analysis to quantify

## Slide 6: Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Factor | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------------|-------------|---------|------------|
| False Positives | High | Medium | Staff override protocols |
| Customer Complaints | Medium | High | Transparent communication |
| Technical Failures | Medium | Medium | Redundant systems |
| Staff Resistance | High | High | Change management program |

**Overall Risk Level:** HIGH

---

## Slide 7: Alternative Approaches

### Recommended Pilot Program
**Phase 1 (3 months):**
- Deploy in 5 flagship stores
- Focus on cold drinks in transparent containers
- Standard recipes only (no customizations)

**Phase 2 (6 months):**
- Expand to include basic hot drinks
- Test customer acceptance of transparent containers
- Refine false positive detection

### Alternative Solutions
1. **Recipe Training App** - Digital training tool for baristas
2. **Spot Check System** - Random quality audits with mobile devices
3. **Customer Feedback Integration** - Real-time quality feedback loop

---

## Slide 8: Recommendations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)
1. **Decline current proposal** as presented
2. **Approve pilot program** budget ($200K)
3. **Form cross-functional team** (IT, Operations, Training)

### Success Metrics for Pilot
- **Accuracy Rate:** >95% for monitored drinks
- **Service Speed Impact:** <5% slowdown
- **Staff Satisfaction:** Neutral or positive feedback
- **Customer Complaints:** <2% increase

### Go/No-Go Decision Point
Review pilot results in 6 months for full deployment consideration

## Slide 9: Q&A

**Prepared for common questions:**
- "Where do these numbers come from?" â†’ Transparency slide on data sources
- Cost comparison with manual quality control
- Timeline for alternative solutions
- Technical specifications and vendor options
- Impact on franchise locations vs. corporate stores

---

## Slide 10: Data Sources & Assumptions
**Transparency Note for CEO**

### What We Know:
- Current store count and basic operational metrics
- General industry hardware costs for retail tech
- Typical software development project ranges

### What We Estimated (30-min analysis):
- Container type distribution (based on menu observation)
- Customization rates (based on industry averages)
- Implementation timeline and costs (based on similar projects)

### What We Need:
- **2-week analysis:** POS data for accurate customization rates
- **Vendor quotes:** Specific hardware and software costs
- **Operational study:** Actual impact on service speed and quality

**Recommendation:** Approve preliminary feasibility study before major investment decision
